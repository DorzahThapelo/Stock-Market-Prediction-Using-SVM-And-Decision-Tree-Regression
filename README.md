# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-SVM-And-Decision-Tree-Regression
The proposed intelligent application prototype to solve the problem of stock market movement prediction is using of Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree Regression. Numerous stock prediction techniques have emerged as a result of the computing performance's fast growth, and techniques for extracting information from data are becoming more popular. Data mining may be used to uncover patterns in stock prices that can be used to forecast the future trajectory of the company because there is a wealth of historical stock data available, making this an interesting topic for this study. 

## 1.	Importing the Libraries
The first step of developing of the stock market prediction model using Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Regressions, all the libraries were imported. Pandasâ€™ library was imported as will be dealing with dataset processing of csv file and NumPy was imported to deal with the linear algebra. 

Matplotlib.pylot library was imported to deal with the plotting of the graphs including the graph styling.

Sklearn libraries were used to import machine learning libraries. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to develop the model and the SVC library was loaded from sklearn.svm in order to forecast the behavior of the stock market. Additionally, the DecisionTreeRegression package from sklearn.tree was imported for the model's prediction. Accuracy score from sklearn.metrics was imported for assessment under the test outcomes.

## 2.	Data Ingestion
Then comes the loading of the dataset that will be using to develop the proposed prototype. The dataset that is used was downloaded from Yahoo! Finance and was of the Apple Inc, for the period from 2nd of January 2020 till 23rd of November 2022. The dataset daily high price, lowest price, closing price of the market in the prior trading period. The loaded dataset was extracted as a csv file.

## 3.	Data Preparation
Data analysis using visual techniques is called exploratory data analysis. By utilizing statistical summaries and graphical representations, it is utilized to identify trends and patterns as well as to verify hypotheses.. By performing an exploratory data analysis on the stock price data, we will look at how the stock prices have evolved over time and how the end of each quarter affects the stock prices. The visualization of the Apple Inc. stock market dataset was plotted on the exploratory data analysis to show the Opening Prices, High Prices, Low Prices, and the Close Price on a daily basis.

## 4.	Exploratory Data Analysis
Data analysis using visual techniques is called exploratory data analysis. Graphs and statistical summaries are used to identify trends and patterns, as well as to verify hypotheses. By performing an exploratory data analysis on the stock price data, we will look at how the stock prices have evolved over time and how the end of each quarter affects the stock prices. The visualization of the Apple Inc. stock market dataset was plotted on the exploratory data analysis to show the Opening Prices, High Prices, Low Prices, and the Close Price on a daily basis.
